            <p>There are numerous amounts of exercises you can do that'll benefit your body.</p>
            <p> Want to lose weight? You'll most likely be better off doing more cardio intense workouts than weight training. However, did you know that muscles help burn fat?  </p>
            <p> Want those six-pack abs? Well, it's not going to be easy. I personally made it a goal to achieve this appearence a few months ago and it was a lot! Train your abdominal muscle group anywhere from 3-4 times a week (remember rest is important). Follow up with some cardio and good meals. Your "abs" are like any other muscle group and require care. If you're eating poorly, no matter how much exercise your doing, <strong>you won't see anything.</strong></p>
            
            <p> Men tend to hold the most fat around their lower belly. That layer of fat will cover your abs. There are no exercises that specifically target/ burn fat. It's a long process of burning fat all over your body, and burning the fat from your stomach area will be the last to go. It takes <strong>time.</strong></p>

            <p> A lot of people's interpetations on food are wrong. Food is important. You need it to fuel your body. Many people make the mistake of starving themselves when wanting to lose weight. <strong>Don't do this.</strong> You're only ruining your metabolism and will very quickly go back to old habits.</p>
            <p>You don't need to <strong>just</strong> eat salads or fruit. You can still ENJOY other foods and besides, who wants to eat the same thing everyday? I personally meal prep. Eating 2.5oz of Chicken breast, 2 cups of white rice and 85g of broccoli. </p>
            
            <p>Realistically, you can still eat anything you want, <strong> with moderation.</strong> Too much of anything is bad for you. But, there are more options to eating! <strong>Intermittent Fasting</strong> is a 16 hour time period in which you are not eating, and an 8 hour period where you are eating. I personally do this! Eating from 4:00pm - 8:00pm and fasting for 20 hours. I'm essentially burning calories by doing nothing except drinking water! (ps, it's a lot harder than it seems but it's worth it). </p>
